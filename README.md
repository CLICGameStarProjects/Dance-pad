#### Gameplay

> :information_source: **Note!** Once the setup done, the players can use the menu by themselves. It is best, however, to have an operator to help.

1) Select "Local play".

![gameplay1](./img/mod/gameplay1.png)

2) Select "Shared screen".

![gameplay2](./img/mod/gameplay2.png)

3) Choose a duration.

> :information_source: **Note!** Roughly, the length of the game corresponds to the number of stages. Remember that the players are using dancepads, so we recommand no more than 5 minutes.

![gameplay3](./img/mod/gameplay3.png)

4) Select "No" when asked about Mutators.

> :warning: **Warning!** You may want to try using Mutators, but it's _really_ difficult when using a dancepad...

![gameplay4](./img/mod/gameplay4.png)

5) On the character selection, if a character is already present, dismiss it using a keyboard and selecting the "Quit" button. Then, on each dancepad, press once any arrow, then twice the Down arrow, then once the Up arrow.

> :information_source: **Note!** If people are feeling like it, you can of course customise each character!

6) Select your stages. Either use a mouse, or leave it to the players to select them.

> :warning: **Warning!** Some of the maps are really difficult with the dancepads, namely, every map using a special action to do ("Pres ... to do ..."). We recommand _not_ to select them.
